///
/// - Hold fn: `begin` on press, `commit` on release.
/// - Tap fn twice fast: `begin` on the first press, then `lock` on the second press (hands-free).
/// - One fn press while locked: `commit` when that press is released.
/// - One short tap with no second tap: `cancel` (nothing was said).
/// - With `tapToggles` on: one short tap locks at once (`begin`, then `lock` on release), and the
///   next press ends it (`commit` on release). Holding still works as push to talk.
/// - Another modifier (⌘ ⌥ ⌃ ⇧) with fn: `cancel` while listening. fn alone is the only trigger.
/// - Any other key while fn is held or just tapped (fn+⌫, fn+arrows, fn+F-keys): `cancel`.
